    "## Project Goals\n",
    "The team, **Nick Ouellet and Garrett Gilliom**, will be investigating data sets related to public school districts that measure student, faculty, and staff demographics, school district academic performance and finances, and more. So far, the team has come across two data sets for Louisiana school districts and many more for New Jersey school districts. Collectively, the data measures different variables and attributes of each state's school districts across the same year; the data is also well-populated and taken from each state's Department of Education, which is a reputable source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial will investigate the following questions:\n",
    "- **What relationships exist between variables of financial, or otherwise demographic, data and the academic performance of school districts?** Examples:\n",
    "    * How important a role does teacher compensation play in testing scores?\n",
    "    * Is overall funding or spending of school district at all indicative of its academic performance?\n",
    "    * Which areas are most effective at promoting successful test scores? For example, does allocating money to extracurriculars like sports aid or hinder testing scores?\n",
    "- **Louisiana is consistently ranked as a low-performing state, education-wise. What differences exist between Louisiana and other high-performaing states that may highlight why Louisiana is ranked as such?**\n",
    "- **Can data from one or a small group of states allow for the prediction of academic performance of other states' school districts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Plan\n",
    "The team plans to meet once a week to work on this project to finalize our project vision, determine objectives, and assist each other where necessary. We will also be communicating thoroughly over text messages to keep each other updated with task progress and will be using Google Docs to keep an ongoing list of to-do items that’s accessible by each of us at all times. The team has also set up a shared Github repository to store, coordinate, and update our code."

The team has found this to be surprising, especially considering this was found across both data sets. While strange, this information could be used to pinpoint school districts that may be collecting a strong amount of money, only to spend it in an irresponsible way. More investigation could be further complete to detemrine why school districts with high funding amounts are underperforming in both states, and vise-versa.\n",

    "As a result of the initial exploratory data analysis completed on data sets relating to financial information and academic performance of both New Jersey and Louisiana school districts, the team has deteremined new questions to consider in the future:\n",

    "- **What relationships exist between variables of financial, or otherwise demographic, data and academic performance of school districts?**\n",
    "    - i.e. does student/teacher ratio, diversity, or enrollment size relate to academic performance?\n",
    "- **If a relationship is found, can the team predict the relative academic performances of the school districts of states, given the relevant data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For these questions, we are looking to test whether academic performance is dependent on other aspects of school districts. Other ways the team plans on testing for relationships is by numerically calculating $r^2$ values and other statistics that represent the strength of relationships between two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's vital that the team continues to test new attributes the school districts in search for relevant relationships. Even if none are found, however, it should be interesting to note the absence of such relationships when testing variables that are expected to relate to one another.</br> </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The team's next steps primarily involve three main strategies:\n",
    "- **Test new financial, identity, demographic, or other attributes of each school district and compare them to academic performance**\n",
    "- **Determine more methods to evaluate student performance, beyond average ACT score and 4-year graduation rate**\n",
